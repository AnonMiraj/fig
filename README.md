# FIG (Fortran Intuitive Graphics)
FIG is a proof-of-concept library for Fortran that aims to provide intuitive graphics capabilities. It offers basic 2D primitives such as lines, circles, ellipsis, and rectangles for creating graphical representations within Fortran programs.

you can generate them yourself using `fpm test`

### todo
- [ ] better cirlces drawing and filling 
- [ ] pro drawing for rectangle the supports rotating and such
- [ ] support png and the alpha channel
